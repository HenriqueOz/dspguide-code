Some python and Octave/MATLAB scripts to help explore some of the concepts and algorithms from the outstanding free textbook [*The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing*](http://www.dspguide.com/). I make no pretense that these are good scripts, and there are certainly far better implementations. Some of these are intentionally not coded optimally because they are exploring how signals work conceptually, not how the code should be written in reality. It started as an excuse to relearn some python, then switched to Octave, then MATLAB.
